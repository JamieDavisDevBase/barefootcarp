    <h1>Bare Foot Carpentry</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project will be to have something to showcase in my professional portfolio.</p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>This site is designed for anyone digging into my portfolio.</p>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The primary goal is to give my portfolio more depth upon DDC graduation. A secondary goal of creating this website is for my side hustle, should I ever decide to step up production.</p>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
            <h3>Name</h3>
                <p>Sally Sassafrass</p>
            <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>62</p>
            <h3>Profession</h3>
                <p>Retired flight attendant</p>
            <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>Uses Windows 10 on her Dell OptiPlex 3080 and Android on her Samsung Galaxy S10e.</p>
            <h3>Attitudes and Behavior</h3>
                <p>Plenty of time and in no hurry, she wants to find a gift she can give and also buy for herself that includes a picture of her grandchildren (who helped her set up her phone and computer).</p>
            <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
                <p>Though she may have time on her hands, she has no interest in complicated check-out processes or hefty internet searches. She wants the right gift, but also desires a streamlined website from which to order it from.</p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Sally needs a gift, but will not spend more than 10 minutes on a website, and definitely no more than 5 minutes in the purchase process.</p>
            <h3>User Story</h3>
                <p>"As a less than casual user, I need to be able to easily navigate a website without any unpleasant surprises."</p>
